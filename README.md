# Portfolio mk2: [JohnZolton.dev](https://www.johnzolton.dev/)

This repository contains the source code for my portfolio website. It is built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS. The architecture emphasizes component-driven design and displays a modern aesthetic.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework that simplifies the development process and improves performance.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: An open-source language that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Component Driven Design

This website adheres to the principles of Component-Driven Design (CDD). With CDD, we break down the design into reusable components, each responsible for a single functionality, resulting in a modular and maintainable codebase. The components are self-contained, reusable, and easy to test.
